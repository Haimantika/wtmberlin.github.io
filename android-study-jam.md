This event is for all those taking their first steps in learning programming for Android development.

Whether you’ve already started or have zero programming experience, have a side project or are searching for a job, come and join us at the Android Study Jam: a series of 3 workshops run by Women Techmakers in conjunction with the organisers of the Berlin Android community. This is the 5th edition of the Android Study Jam and with this event trio we are testing a new format, hope you will enjoy it! 

During the course, you will get a general overview of mobile development for Android, learn basic programming concepts as well as core vocabulary and concepts in Android, get hands-on experience building a small app using the Kotlin language, and understand what opportunities exist for you in the vibrant Berlin tech scene as an Android programmer. https://github.com/WTMBerlin/AndroidStudyJam2019

Besides technical skills, we will also cover other important skills for being an effective programmer, such as communicating your progress, giving and receiving feedback, searching for learning resources. And much more! 🚀
