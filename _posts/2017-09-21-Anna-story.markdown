A few years ago I started **studying computer science without any prior programming experience. And in German**. Women Techmakers Berlin helped me to accomplish this challenging goal so I give back to the community as much as I can by supporting the organizer's team. 
I currently work as a software developer and absolutely love it.


### Rough start
As progrmming wasn’t a required skill for my new field of study I just figured out it wouldn’t be a problem to learn it.
It turned out to be harder than I had estimated. Most of my peers had already had some courses in high school or were already skilled coders. Others, who also came inexperienced quickly decided to drop out. So after a month I was facing a situation where I was lagging a bit behind and didn’t know anybody encountering the same difficulties.  
I managed to pass a few exams, but after a few months I still wasn’t feeling good about my coding skills and was thinking about switching the major.


Before I gave up, I wanted to try and do my best. I enrolled in a few online courses, liked a bunch of suggested pages on Facebook. One of the pages was “Women Techmakers Berlin”. They were announcing a new edition of an Android Study Jam “Built your first Android App”. Meetups, support of the coaches, snacks… And everything free of charge!  

At first I thought it might be some kind of a scam, because honestly, it sounded too good to be true.   
My assumptions couldn’t have been more wrong. Not only was it a fully free course, it was also well prepared and made a huge difference for my career path.  


The Meetups were held at ImmoScout24, one of the coolest office spaces in Berlin.  
There were snacks and unlimited drinks. Long tables with enough power outlets for all. We also got Swag and by that I mean well designed bags, notebooks, stickers and other merchandise.

### Android Study Jam Meetups byWomen Techmakers Berlin
The first weeks of the course weren't very intense for me as I was already familiar with the basics, for example with the concept of variables. It was meant as an introduction for complete beginners (which is a great thing, encourage your sister, friend, mom to join some workshops or courses for complete beginners, it is fun to have learned such a useful skill!). The course was really *well structured*.  
There were also many tutors, always eager to help. During one of the classes I made my first super simple one-screen app - a picture of a cat and some birthday wishes. I put it on my mobile phone it was great to show it to my friends and family. 


I went through the course, did my lessons and homework and discussed any trouble in the process with the coaches during the meetups.   
Those meetups had a *really welcoming atmosphere*, thanks to Natalie Pistunovich and all the tutors. I felt free to ask them all possible questions. Observing them, especially Natalie made it visible for me, how in this attitude of mutual growth my career path could look like.
Over the course we were developing an app and me and my fellow course participants got to present it on a graduation event. My friends won free of charge Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree. We still keep in touch. If you haven’t seen it yet, you should definitely check Lara Martin’s story on Medium. *https://medium.com/udacity/a-year-of-android-ffba9f3e40b6*. Lara has recently been announced a Google Developer Expert on Flutter, technology of developing software for Android and iOS.
I also got a small award, a Google Card Board, which I am really proud of still. Each participant got a certificate for completing the course.  Have I already mentioned there were around **30 pizzas**?

### After the course
Overall it was a really fun time in which I improved my coding skills, gained a lot of self-confidence and even got a job at my University, where I was developing a real Android app. I got the job thanks to my knowledge and this little portfolio from the Android Study Jam!  

After a few weeks I was offered a scholarship for the Android Fast Track by Udacity – a continuation of the Beginner's course with weekly meetups for more advanced topics. They also paid the fee for the Google Android Developer Certificate – both are around 800€ in total so it was a really nice surprise.  

Since my Android adventure has started it has slowly turned into a passion. I invest a lot of time into learning android and make an awesome progress. I joined the Google Developer Groups Android organizers team and co-organize a weekly Android Study Group and monthly meetups. I currently work as an Anroid Developer at the very same company that sponsored the course where I learned to code 4 years ago and I am a great asset to an even more amazing team. Learning to code as an adult, I really appriciate this new world of opportunities that is now open. 

### Community

I advocate programming to non-techies because I can clearly see, how much of a positive influence WTM has not only on me, but also on many others who attend our meetups. I hear stories and it is very gratyfing to find out people attending our meetups found a job or learned a new skill or at least heard and saw something interesting, made connections.
The Group is active globally, so if you move or travel there is a good chance there are some WTM meetups in the area.  
I also strongly identify with the idea of empowering people through providing them an access to education. Natalie, the organizer I mentioned previously, worked in Kenya with an institute that provides free technical education to young adults right in underprivilidged areas.

### Berlin Tech Scene

Living in Berlin we have a privilidge of endless opportunities as the meetup scene is insanely active. Conferences, meetups, slack, Twitter and other online presence contribute to this boom and loction - Berlin gives it an additional touch. People talk about work life balance, inclusivity and diversity and the food plates are recycleble. Some events are child or dog friendly!


The demand for tech people is rising and doesn’t seem to stop in the near future. To fulfill this demand, companies are **not only looking for people who graduated from university. The practical skills and a good cultural fit are the decisive factor. You don’t need to be a super pro in all kind of programming languages and algorithms. If you have those skills  - amazing - if not, be eager to learn as much as you can while maintaining a healthy work life ratio.
I think many people are kind of afraid of doing the first step because they believe computer science in general is too complicated or too hard for them. Prior to learning coding I was imagining it takes a lifetime to learn one programming language and now after this little time I used several of them**

>The demand for tech people is rising and doesn’t seem to stop in the near future.

This false belief comes partially from the fact that computer scientists can do some pretty awesome and complicated stuff.  
Machine Learning and AI are complex topics but if you don't have a programming background and you follow a tutorial you will be still able to build a simple program. 

You don’t need to be a math genius (it’s great when you are one but in many jobs, you don't need math at all) to be awesome at your work in a tech sector. I mention it explicitly, as this is the reply I get the most often when I encourage people to programmming. There are so many fields which require gathering a lot of knowledge, but are not that complicated from the maths perspective. "Just" complex, that’s all ande people are also passionate about them. Testers, User Interface designers, Quality Analists..

If you have some time, and by that I mean you have to be ready for honest hours of learning some concepts, syntax or whatever, and you think about requalifying, please do that. The spectrum is so wide it would be hard not to find something you will enjoy doing…

> IT sector is so broad it would be hard not to find something you will enjoy doing…

A friend of mine found a hackathon, he is a machine learning specialist. A hackathon is an event where you not necessarily hack something but rather code together with others, the whole day and night.  
Afterwards I asked him how it was. “It was okay I guess” he said. “We haven’t finished, it was something other than I have expected. We were developing an Android app. What a pity you weren’t there!”  Well no worries, I’ll be there next time!
