##### International Women's Day
[International Women's Day (IWD)](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/) is marked on March 8th every year. In different regions, the focus of celebrations ranges from general respect and appreciation for women to a celebration of women's economic, political, and social achievements.

##### Building a New Horizon
This year's theme is _Building a New Horizon_. 

Building a new horizon means *creating* a new path, *opening* our perspective to new possibilities, asking *new* questions, *discovering* new worlds.

This new horizon is built **together**, its elements are everyone's dreams, opinions and perspectives, to make better decisions in our companies, in our homes and families, to make our world, the only home we have ever known, a better place. 

Join us in our journey to a tech community more diverse and inclusive!
