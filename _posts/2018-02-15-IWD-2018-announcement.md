##### International Women's Day
[International Women's Day (IWD)](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/) is marked on March 8th every year. In different regions, the focus of celebrations ranges from general respect and appreciation for women to a celebration of women's economic, political, and social achievements.

##### Building a New Horizon
This year's theme is _Building a New Horizon_. 

Building a new horizon means *creating* a new path, *opening* our perspective to new possibilities, asking *new* questions, *discovering* new worlds.

This new horizon is built **together**, its elements are everyone's dreams, opinions and perspectives, to make better decisions in our companies, in our homes and families, to make our world, the only home we've ever known, a better place. 

We want to help by encouraging diversity in tech while collaborating to make the tech community of Berlin diverse and inclusive!

##### I want to join!
